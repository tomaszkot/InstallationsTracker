# InstallationsTracker
Uninstall apps. even these  which windows uninstaller fails to handle

Simple app allowing you to search for installed apps and uninstall them.
There are two kinds of removal possible:
- Uninstall - official way, it calls uninstaller of the app. Please note that if app has a bundle installer using this tool you might unsistall each part of the bundle separately.
- Force Uninstall - that one brutally removes entry from windows registry - then app is no longer considered installed by windows.
